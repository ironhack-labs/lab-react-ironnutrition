# LAB | React IronNutrition

## Introduction

You just realized that since the beginning of the bootcamp, your diet is not healthy and it may have an impact on your health (and productivity), now and in the long term.

To take care of the food you eat, you decided to create a nutrition app that will track everything you eat!

</p>

## Setup

- Fork this repo
- Clone this repo
- Open the LAB and start:

  ```bash
  $ cd lab-react-ironnutrition
  $ npm install
  $ npm start
  ```


## Submission

- Upon completion, run the following commands:

  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "done"
  git push origin master
  ```

- Create a Pull Request so that your TAs can check your work.


## Getting Started

Clean the `App.js` component so that it has the following structure:

```jsx
// src/App.js
import "./App.css";

function App() {
  return <div className="App"></div>;
}
export default App;
```

<br>

## Instructions

### Iteration 0 | Setup

#### Ant Design Installation

We will use [Ant Design](https://ant.design/) component library for the design. :)

```sh
$ npm install antd
```

To make the Ant Design styles available in the entire app, import Ant Design stylesheet in `index.js`:

```javascript
// src/index.js
import "antd/dist/antd.css";
```

#### Ant Design Components

During the LAB we will be using a set of simple Ant Design components that provide basic styling.

Before using any Ant Design component you will first have to import it from the `antd` package. You must import a component in each file where you intend to use it. Example:

```jsx
// EXAMPLE
// To start using the pre-made Ant Design components we must first import them:
import { Card, Row, Col, Divider, Input, Button } from "antd";

function Example() {
  // After importing the components we can render them directly:
  return (
    <div>
      
      <Row>
        <Col>
          <Divider>Fancy Input</Divider>
          <Input value={""} onChange={() => {}} />
        </Col>

        <Col>
          <Card title={"Fancy Card"}>
            <Button onClick={() => {}}>Fancy Button</Button>
          </Card>
        </Col>
      </Row>
      
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### Import a JSON

For now, we will be working in the `App.js`. In the later steps, you can refactor the app and split it into multiple components. Import the array of foods from the `foods.json` file to `App.js`.

```js
import foods from "./foods.json";
```

#### About the design

If you struggle with the design, you can find static examples of what is expected inside the `style-guide/` folder.

So let's start!

### Iteration 1| Render a Simple List

Now that you have the `foods.json` imported in `App.js` it is time to save it in a state variable. Once you have done that, map over the state variable and render a simple list (without styles) that displays food names. You can use the following snippet for the list items:

```jsx
{
  /* Simple list Item */
}
<div>
  <p> FOOD_NAME_HERE </p>
  <img src="FOOD_IMAGE_HERE" width={0} />
</div>
```

![Example - Simple Food List](https://education-team-2020.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/web-dev/lab-react-ironnutrition-1.png)

<br>

### Iteration 2 | Create the `FoodBox` component

Create a new component named `FoodBox` that takes the `food` object as a prop. It should display the card with all the information about the food coming from the `food` prop. The component should render the following content:

```jsx
{
  /* FoodBox component */
}
<Col>
  <Card
    title={"FOOD_NAME_HERE"}
    style={{ width: 230, height: 300, margin: 10 }}
  >
    <img src={"FOOD_IMAGE_HERE"} height={60} />
    <p>Calories: FOOD_CALORIES_HERE</p>
    <p>Servings: FOOD_SERVINGS_HERE</p>
    <p>
      <b>Total Calories: FOOD_CALORIES * FOOD_SERVINGS </b> kcal
    </p>
    <Button type="primary"> Delete </Button>
  </Card>
</Col>
```

Remember to import the Ant Design components `Card`, `Col`, `Divider` and `Button` before using them:

```jsx
import { Card, Col, Divider, Button } from "antd";
```

<br>

### Iteration 3 | Render a List of `FoodBox` Components

After creating the `FoodBox` component, use it in the `App.js` to render the food list. Instead of mapping over the foods array and renderign only the food names, render the `<FoodBox />` component. When rendering `FoodBox` remember to pass the food object as a prop.

Once you are done rendering the `FoodBox` in the list, your app should display the following content:

![Example - render FoodBox component in a list](https://education-team-2020.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/web-dev/lab-react-ironnutrition-3.gif)

<br>

### Iteration 4 | Add new food

Create a new controlled component named `AddFoodForm`, used to add new foods. The component should contain a form with four input elements for `name` , `image` , `calories` and `servings`.

The component should render use the AntDesign component `Input` instead of the the `input` tag. The AntDesign `Input` component uses the same syntax as the regular `input` tag. Example:

```jsx
// HTML <input /> tag
<input value={} type="text" onChange={} />
```

```jsx
// Ant Design <Input /> component
<Input value={} type="text" onChange={} />
```

The component should be rendered in the `App.js`.

When the user clicks submit, the food should be added to the list.

**Hint:** To add new food to the food array in `App.js` you will need to pass a function through the props.

![Example - Add food component](https://education-team-2020.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/web-dev/lab-react-ironnutrition-4.gif)

<br>

### Iteration 5 | Implement search bar

Create a `Search` component to perform a search and filter the list of food items displayed.

![Example - Add food component](https://education-team-2020.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/web-dev/lab-react-ironnutrition-5.gif)

<br>

### Iteration 6 | Create a delete button

Your `FoodBox` component has a delete button. Implement the delete functionality so that when a user clicks on the button, the item gets removed from the food list.

**Hint:** To update the food array from `App.js` you will need to pass a function through the props.

![Example - Add food component](https://education-team-2020.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/web-dev/lab-react-ironnutrition-6.gif)

If you are not sure how to create responsive columns with Ant Design, you can check the example provided in the Ant Design [documentation](https://ant.design/components/grid/#components-grid-demo-playground).

<br>

### Iteration 7 | Bonus | Hide the Add Food Form

There are quite a few components displaying in the app. Implement a hide/show button that when clicked, hides/shows the `AddFoodForm`. When the form is showing the button should display the message <kbd>Hide Form</kbd> and when the form is hidden it shoud display <kbd>Add New Food</kbd>.

![Example - Hide Add food component](https://education-team-2020.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/web-dev/lab-react-ironnutrition-7.gif)

<br>

### Iteration 8 | Bonus | Display a Feedback Message

Display a Feedback message to the user when the food array is empty. For example, once all of the items are deleted from the list the user should see the a message that looks like this:

![Example - Add food component](https://education-team-2020.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/web-dev/lab-react-ironnutrition-8.gif)
