// if delete = {deleteFood} in App.jsx, all naming are changed; 
// -> onClick={() => delete(food.id)
// -> const { food, delete } = props;
//but the function it gets {deltedFood}, which was defined in App.jsx remains the same.

//ACTIONS-UP
// "deleteFood" is part of the "actions-up" pattern because it allows 
// the child component (FoodBox) to trigger an action 
// in the parent component (App) when a deletion operation needs to be performed. 
// The parent component then handles the action by modifying its state accordingly. 
// This pattern helps maintain a clear separation of concerns and allows for 
// better data management and state updates in React applications.
